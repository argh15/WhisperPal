## Installation Steps

1. **Connect to Database:**
   - **Check for Database Path:**
     - Ensure you have a `/data/db` path. If it doesn't exist, create it using:
       ```bash
       mkdir -p /data/db
       ```
     - Ensure the directory has the correct permissions:
       ```bash
       sudo chown -R `id -u` /data/db
       ```
   - **Specify a Different Data Directory (Optional):**
     - If you prefer a different path, specify it with the `--dbpath` option when starting MongoDB:
       ```bash
       mongod --dbpath /path/to/your/directory
       ```
     - Update the MongoDB configuration file (`mongod.conf`) to set the `storage.dbPath`:
       ```yaml
       storage:
         dbPath: /path/to/your/directory
       ```

2. **Start the Server:**
   - Navigate to the server directory:
     ```bash
     cd server
     ```
   - Install dependencies:
     ```bash
     npm install
     ```
   - Start the server:
     ```bash
     npm start
     ```

3. **Start the Client:**
   - Navigate to the public directory:
     ```bash
     cd public
     ```
   - Start the client (React app):
     ```bash
     npm start
     ```
